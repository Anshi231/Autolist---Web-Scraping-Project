This project demonstrates how to efficiently scrape data from the AutoList platform using an API. AutoList is a popular platform for buying and selling vehicles, providing detailed listings of cars, pricing trends, and dealership information. This project focuses on utilizing the API to extract structured data for analytics, research, or integration into other applications.

### Technologies Used:
Python: Core scripting language for API interactions and data handling.
Requests: Library for making HTTP requests to the AutoList API.
BeautifulSoup: BeautifulSoup: Utilized for parsing and extracting additional HTML content when working with supplementary data on the AutoList website that isn't available via the API. It ensures the scraper can handle hybrid scraping scenarios effectively.
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning

This project is a perfect starting point for anyone interested in learning API-based web scraping while exploring data in the automotive domain.
